# Interpreting neurons in Qwen3.5-4B: methodology

A working method for explaining a single MLP neuron, built from hands-on investigation in the explorer. It complements the explorer prompt above and uses its vocabulary (poles, steer lens, cone, web summary).

## Mindset

- **A neuron is a target, not a word list.** Every input makes a small judgement, and the strongest firing is where they all agree. Name the neuron from its strongest firings; weaker firings are usually the same idea seen from further away (Cammarata, *Neural Networks Are Already Clean*: neurons are analogizers, "Titanic-ish" rather than "Titanic facts").
- **Think in situations and distinctions.** Good labels describe a moment in text and what the neuron does there: "a line style comes next", "eggs as a counted ingredient", "we're comparing something, but HOW?". Noun categories ("hazard words", "graspable objects") are usually too literal.
- **Read the input and output as a pair.** "Already knows X → writes Y" is the most productive single move. `L20 N7531` is fed by `compare`, `either`, `comparison`, `corresponding` and writes `first/second`, `upper/lower`, `smaller/larger`: given that a comparison is happening, it supplies how to tell the items apart.
- **The strange part is the pointer.** When one view disagrees with the others, that disagreement is where the next test goes.
- **The network's ideas are often better than ours.** A clean neuron need not match an English word.

## Workflow

1. **Read `neuron` and `web_summary`.** Note `fed_by` / `held_by` (input), steer lens with KL (direct effect), `toward` / `away` and the strongest `writes_into` (downstream). Form a guess from the input/output pair.
2. **Steer on an open prompt** ("Tell me about your weekend.", "Write a short poem about the ocean.") at dose 0.6–0.8, then 1.5–2. Steering finds the axis faster than test sentences, especially for neurons that seldom fire. Read both rows: a meaningful negative pole writes something recognisable; a meaningless one just loops or breaks.
3. **Find where it fires hard.** Use `compare` with matched sets: target texts, near misses that share the vocabulary but not the situation, and distant controls. Raise the target until something exceeds the neuron's `act_max`. If nothing does, sweep 25–50 varied snippets (news, code, recipes, chat, fiction, maths, Chinese) with `compare` (24 texts per call) and read off the peaks.
4. **Check that the peak is real, then explain it from upstream.** At the peak token, zero candidate upstream neurons (`mode: mul, dose: 0`), whole MLP layers (`{layer, all: true, dose: 0}`) and attention per layer and per head, and measure the drop. Group the drivers by meaning.
5. **Break the hypothesis on purpose.** Write the test that would falsify it and run it: same frame with the key word swapped (prices vs customs differ; `def scale` vs `def process`), same word without the situation ("What color is bleach?").
6. **Run a blind maximum.** Write one sentence from the label alone. If it beats every example found so far, the label is near the center (`L20 N7531`: 2.44 from "The ratio of prices between the two regions differs by a factor of three", above its 0.93 dataset max).
7. **Close with logprobs.** `logprobs` with the neuron zeroed or pushed shows exactly which next tokens it moves and by how much. This is the final word on what the neuron does to the output.

## Reading each source

- **Steer lens.** Tokens such as `作为` (as a…), `您的` (your, polite), `无法` / `cannot`, `我是一个` (I am a…) appear across a great many neurons. They are a signature of measuring on chat prompts and carry little information about the specific neuron. Weight the remaining, specific tokens.
- **Logit lens.** Most useful in late layers. Specific repeated tokens (`method` × 12, `egg` × 12) are reliable; mixed fragments are noise.
- **Web summary.** Pooled steer-lens words over the cone. A token on both `fed_by` and `held_by` (e.g. `XSS`, `（`, `.`) often reflects pooling; treat shared topical words differently, see "Fed and held by the same topic" below.
- **Weight links (`writes_into`, `reads_from`, cone).** Leads to check, never circuits. Verify any claimed path with activations under ablation; `L22 N3467 → L31 N1348` was a real, causal link whose removal changed nothing in the output.
- **Activation range.** Raw values. Scores many times `act_max` (18× for cosine, 39× for line styles) mark a detector at its center.

## Motifs seen in this model

- **Lookahead.** Many neurons fire on the token before the thing they predict: `L25 N4719−` peaks at "r times **the**" before "cosine" (−15) and at "sin² **+**" before "cos²"; `L22 N5826` peaks at "while **the**" before "dashed".
- **Summary positions.** Mood and planning neurons peak on commas, periods, `?`, `</think>` and the blank line before a reply, where attention gathers the text so far. `L22 N3467` (critical warning) reaches 6.2 at `</think>` before an answer to a bleach question.
- **Reads one way, writes the other.** Some neurons fire positive on a topic while their positive direction writes the opposite register: `L18 N8827` fires on lurid content and, pushed positive, makes text gentle and serene; its negative pole is obscenity.
- **Fed and held by the same topic.** A neuron that draws a distinction inside a topic is wired to neurons on both sides of it. `L10 N6032` is fed by `unsafe`, `vulnerable`, `attack` and held by `secure`, `Police`, `FDA`: it marks danger with no safeguard in place.
- **One direction, signed by context (gain control).** `L23 N7748` adds eggs in counted-ingredient slots (+5.75 at "a dozen") and, at −3.3 in "bacon and fried", holds eggs back so `potatoes` and `toast` stay in play. Logprobs confirm both.
- **Distributed triggers.** Planning neurons are often driven by many small inputs plus attention rather than one upstream switch. `L22 N3467`'s 6.2 is spread across L9–L10 MLPs, L17–L18 heads and several safety neurons, with L11–L17 MLPs acting as a brake.
- **High-gain, rare writers.** A huge steer KL with almost no natural firing marks a lever whose trigger lies outside test sentences. `L26 N4405` (KL 7.4) turns any answer into zeros ("A spider has 0 legs") yet fires only weakly on CSS `margin`, with negligible effect there. Label these by effect and mark the trigger as unknown.
- **Meaning over spelling.** `L20 N7531` fires on `is_larger`, `compare`, `ratio`, `differ` but not on `>`, `==` or `max()`; `L25 N4719` ignores words that merely start with "co-".

## Doses

- 0.5–0.8 shows the direction while keeping text coherent; 1.5–2 often collapses into loops. Last-layer token neurons (e.g. `L29 N1053`, "bro") loop at any dose.
- Pushes add up across neurons; when stacking, scale each one down.

## Writing it up

- Lead with the strongest firings and the steering result, then the near misses that bound the label.
- State the verdict (one job / two related jobs / not yet understood) with confidence, and say which view you weight when views disagree.
- Name what remains unexplained.
- End with the specific test that would break the explanation.

## Reference neurons

- `L10 N6032+`: risky how-to request ("How do I store gasoline?") → caution voice (`我必须` I must, `我无法` I can't).
- `L11 N6261+`: refusal lever; +1.5 moves the first reply token from "I" (99.6%) to "Sure / Yes / Absolutely".
- `L12 N699`: + AI self-limitation ("I can only…"), − bubbly persona ("What a fun day!").
- `L18 N6311`: + frame as a method ("the sourdough method… why this works"), − pontificate about the topic.
- `L18 N8737+`: sexual desire → euphemistic bedroom talk.
- `L19 N7839−`: conspiracy / "the truth they don't want you to know" (−12.6), weak as a steering lever.
- `L19 N9066+`: felt panic (7.3 on exam panic), writes anxious rambling at +0.8.
- `L20 N7531`: comparing amounts → which item / how they rank.
- `L22 N3467`: plans a ⚠️ critical warning before answering a hazardous request.
- `L22 N5826`: a line style comes next (dashed / dotted / broken).
- `L23 N7748`: writes eggs; + counted-ingredient slots, − keeps other foods in play.
- `L25 N4719−`: cosine comes next (x-component → cos).
- `L26 N4405`: writes zero; trigger unknown.
